Password Guessing Game ("Bulls and Cows")

TO DO: //Put your name wherever you can work on stuff
- Implement the password generator for Login, which works on ASCII values and ints to generate truly random passwords (JAY)
- Implement the Login class guess method (JAY)
- Implement the password generator for 2FactorAuth, which generates a 3-5 digit random password comprised of ints
- Implement the 2FactorAuth class guess method (The bulls and cows system described in the link above)
- Driver that runs and determines which class object is called when (JAY)

Below is framework for 3 classes (Superclass Password, Subclasses Login (lvl 1), 2FactorAuth (lvl 2))
/**********************/

(Super)Class Password
private char[] pass; //stores the password generated by the generatePass() method. it is private, and there should be NO get() method in order to protect it. All comparisons done within this class.

public abstract char[] generatePass(); //returns a character array of the password desired, generated randomly, each subclass should override this
public abstract boolean guess(); //runs prompt for player to guess pass, compares using this class's compare() method to determine validity, each subclass should override this

public boolean compare(char[] pass2) //only this method can tell you whether the password was correct or not, will be overloaded in the                                      //2FactorAuth Class but work fine as is with login
{
    if(pass.length !== pass2.length)
        return false;
    for(int i = 0; i<pass.length; i++;) {
        if(pass[i] !== pass2[i])
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}

/**********************/

(Sub)Class Login extends Password

public char[] generatePass() //overridden generatePass() method from superclass Password
//in order to generate valid characters for password, use ints and RNG for ASCII values 33-126 (http://www.asciitable.com/) which is basically all digits, letters (caps and lower), and special symbols such as ^ or ! 

public boolean guess() //overridden from Superclass Password, prompts user to guess password til they get it (returns true if they do, false if they exit)

/**********************/

(Sub)Class 2FactorAuth extends Password
public char[] generatePass() //overridden generatePass() method from superclass Password

public boolean guess() //overridden from Superclass Password, prompts user to guess password til they get it (returns true if they do, false if they exit)
